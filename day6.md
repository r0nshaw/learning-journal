I feel like I am falling farther and farther behind. I have talked to every TA and still am not able to get a grasp on the concept of the day. Each TA has said where I am is ok, but I don't feel the same way.

As the class goes into more complex topics, I am finding it difficult to even communicate what it is I have questions about. 

Today I worked on the cookie project. I was able to display the number of cookies sold in one location. If I had to replicate it, I would have a difficult time doing it again.
