Today was... ok. I have to find a way to get some more sleep. The struggle was real this morning during the lecture. It wasn't the presentation, but rather my ability to focus. I feel somewhat ok with the blocking and the css. I was concerned about the function part of the lecture.

When we were told about pairing, I was intimidated. I felt like working with someone else might be tough because it's tough for me to not be able to pull my own weight. 

The pairing worked out well though. Ramon was patient with me and willing to go slow and go over things multiple times. I appreciated his help working with my code and my loops. I felt good about reading his code, and for the most part, understanding what I was reading.
