Today was a tough day. That seems to be a theme. Mike helped me out quite a bit and Michael offered to help me out tomorrow. I am just struggling and going back and forth between I'm not getting this yet and this is just something I can't get.

I'm going to keep taking it one day at a time and hoping I have a breakthrough tomorrow. 

I worked on object literals today, but it was a struggle. I'm going to call it a night start again tomorrow.
