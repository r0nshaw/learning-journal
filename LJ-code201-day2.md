Today was a tough day. I was dealing with some organization things. I have really been working on keeping a positive mindset and also giving myself grace, especially if I'm taking longer than I wanted to with assignments. 

I struggled with pushing to git from the terminal, but that got easier after talking to Allie. Also, both Allie and Michael helped me with my organization,with cleared some things up.

I'm still optimistic, but also feel like it could be easy to fall behind. I hope I'm not falling into that boat, but I plan to keep rowing along.
